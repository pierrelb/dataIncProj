        The FIFA World Cup takes place every 4 years, and the next edition
        will be in Russia in the summer of 2018. Only Westen European and South
        American nations have participated in the finals of all World Cups, but

        improved performances at the World Cup. The investment in the last 3 decades
        has had an impact in professional soccer, but it's effects on the international
